## Technology Choices

| Technology | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| **Storybook** | Industry standard for UI component libraries. Easily test all component states with dark/light modes and multiple languages. |
| **styled-components** | Provides style isolation—critical for reusable UI libraries to avoid CSS conflicts. |
| **React useState** | Built-in state management was sufficient for this scope. |
| **react-i18next** | Lightweight i18n with good TypeScript support. |
